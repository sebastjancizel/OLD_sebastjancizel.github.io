                        About me
                    </h1>

                    <p>
                        I am a research student in mathematical physics at Magdalen College, University of Oxford. When I'm not working on math and physics I like to think about various things related to machine learning and, in particular, looking for interesting applications of geometry in artificial intelligence and data science.
                    </p>

                        My research lies at the interface of geometry and theoretical physics. I am interested in understanding classes of geometric objects that arise naturally in different corners of string theory.

                        String theory has, over the past few decades, been a curious venue for a profound interaction between mathematics and physics. The efforts to formulate a fundamental quantum theory of gravity have led several branches of pure mathematics to make an appearance in physics. Most notably, geometry in its various forms has started to take on a prominent role. This was not its first appearance. Since the theory of general relativity, it has become clear that there is an inherent geometry underlying the physics of gravity. However, string theorists went beyond the 4 dimensions of space and time and  started thinking about increasingly intricate higher dimensional objects.                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is the basis of my research. I am interested in geometric objects &mdash; higher-dimensional shapes &mdash; that appear in string theory and how their properties manifest in the physical theories they are associated with. Usually with opaque names like G<sub>2</sub> manifolds or GK geometries, these shapes are often of independent mathematical interest. What makes them especially exciting is the fruitful interplay of mathematics and physics that is present. Mathematics provides the foundation for physical theories, whereas physical arguments and intuition guide the mathematical explorations.
