				<p>
					Very recently I came across the <a
						href="https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/2020/08/05/leveraging-machine-learning-to-fuel-new-discoveries-with-the-arxiv-dataset/">
						announcement</a>
					that the metadata of all the articles of the preprint repository Arxiv is available as a dataset on
					Kaggle.
					As a PhD student I live on a daily diet of papers published daily on the high energy physics -
					theory (hep-th) and
					the differential geometry (math.DG) pages of the Arxiv, I thought it would be interesting to play
					around with the data
					to see what the data tells us about the publication habits of theoretical physicists.
				</p>
				<p>
					Since its start in 1991 the scientific community in theoretical physics has more or less completely
					assimilated the Arxiv
					in its workflow. More or less every new paper in high energy physics theory first appears as a
					freely available preprint there
					before it undergoes the peer review and is published in a journal. For the authors the Arxiv
					essentially functions as an open review process where the
					community can read their work and provide feedback (albeit not anonymous). From the point of view of
					individual researchers,
					the benefit is that almost the entire body of work of theoretical physics is collected in one place
					and isn't hiding behind a hefty
					paywall.
				</p>
				<h3>
					Data analysis
				</h3>
				<p>
					In this analysis I wanted to practice basic data wrangling techniques with Python. The full
					data set of all the metadata is about 3.3GB in total (metadata of 1.7 million papers), so it's not
					overwhelming.
					Nonetheless, sifting out the papers with the hep-th tag makes the code run a bit quicker and it's
					easier
					to experiment with on my local computer. The accompanying notebook to this post is <a
						href="https://github.com/sebastjancizel/arxiv_hep-th_eda">
						here</a>. 
					Disclaimer: I will work with all the papers that include a hep-th tag as a category. This means that I won't exclude
					papers with hep-th as a secondary category. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I have extracted my dataset from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/Cornell-University/arxiv">the
						complete dataset on Kaggle.</a> After some manipulation, which I will post on my Kaggle profile
					I end up with the hep-th data frame where a sample entry looks like

				<h3>
					General submission trends
				</h3>
				<p>
					The first thing I wanted to know about is simply the general submission trends in hep-th. What is
					the average number per month? What are the busiest days in a year? How what are the trends?
					Plotting the monthly submission rates we get this graph:
				</p>
				<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless"
					src="./arxiv_eda_data/publication_rate.html" name="igraph" width="100%" height="500"></iframe>
				<p>
					It's clear that the overall publication rate is trending upwards even though the trend is fairly
					modest.
					But the most interesting feature, in my view, is the fact that there is a very well defined peak
					month
					every year starting with 2015 &mdash; December. It seems that every year, come December, physicists
					start
					clamoring to get their papers in before the new year (I was guilty of that as well with my first
					paper).
					In fact, the peak day of 2019 was December 31st. This shows that we must have great holiday plans.
				</p>
				<h3>
					Number of authors
				</h3>
				<p>
					The conventional wisdom is that more and more papers have multiple authors. This always
					seemed pretty obvious from looking at the submissions list every day but now I have the dataset
					so I might as well see what's there. Counting the authors on all the papers we get the following
					distribution.
				</p>
				<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless"
					src="./arxiv_eda_data/author_number.html" name="igraph" width="100%" height="500"></iframe>
				<p>
					So roughly a third of all the submissions has two authors and more than two thirds have multiple
					authors.
					However, this doesn't say much about what the trends are. It's straightforward though to compute
					the percentages of papers with x authors in a given year and plot that.
				</p>
				<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless"
					src="./arxiv_eda_data/yearly_author_no.html" name="igraph" width="100%" height="500"></iframe>
				<p>
					The trends are clearly visible in this plot. It's striking that single author publications accounted
					for
					45% of the yearly submissions in 1993 but the number has since fallen to 23%. The proportion of two
					author
					papers has stayed pretty much the same throughout, but there was a significant increase in the
					number of
					submissions with three and four authors.
				</p>
				<h3>
					Page counts
				</h3>
				<p>
					Finally, let's turn to page counts. This is a bit trickier because the metadata doesn't contain that
					information
					explicitly. It does contain comments that frequently include page count. Searching the comments with
					a regular
					expression it turns out that 86% of all comments contain the word page preceded by some number.
					We'll assume
					that the number gives the number of pages in the paper. This will certainly be wrong in some cases
					but it
					does give a useful estimate, since it is common practice to include page count in the comment.
				</p>
				<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless"
					src="./arxiv_eda_data/pages_number.html" name="igraph" width="100%" height="500"></iframe>
				<p>
					The most common number of pages in a paper seems to be around 10, with 75% of the papers being
					less than 28 pages long. The histogram just shows the data for papers with less than 100 pages.
					But there are certainly quite a few with much more than that. I was curious to see which paper
					has as claim to the most number of pages. That turns out to be <a

					This is actually I paper that I came across in my research! It has all the Lie algebra
					branching rules you'll ever need. And thousands more.
				</p>
				<h3>
					Conclusion
				</h3>
				<p>
					There are several directions one can take this and do more nuanced data exploration with this.
					I think I will focus back on the complete data set and try to understand that data set in a bit
					more detail. I am very tempted to use this data set and try to train an RNN to generate hep-th
					paper titles.
