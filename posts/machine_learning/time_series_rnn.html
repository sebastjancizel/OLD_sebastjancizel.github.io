				<p>The COVID related lockdowns resulted in quite a surge in
					people picking up new hobbies. My activity of choice was to get
					to grips with the practical implementations of neural networks
					in Keras and TensorFlow. And the datasets I usually find most
					interesting are time series of various sorts it seemed natural
					to learn about NNs by applying them to try to modelling and
					forecasting time series. These notes are effectively notes to
					self I've made along the way.</p>
				<h3>Time series and sequence models</h3>
				<p>The basic problem is the following. A simple (univariate)
					time series is a sequence of numbers \[x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots,
					x_t, \dots\,.\] The numbers can be anything from daily COVID
					cases to the daily stock prices on the London Stock Exchange.
					One thing we want to do with time series is to try and predict
					the future values based on our knowledge of the past values.
					Concretely, suppose that we have a week's worth of data (daily
					profit of a company for example) and want to predict the value
					of the time series on Monday \[ x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6,
					x_7 \longrightarrow x_8\,.\] There are various statistical
					models of time series one could apply to this problem, but
					we’re interested in working with neural nets here.</p>
				<p>Given that data is sequential it makes sense to use the
					architecture of neural nets that is good at capturing the time
					dependence of the data points. Intuitively the more recent the
					data is, the more likely it is to influence the current and
					future values. This is why I first wanted to build a recurrent
					neural network model. RNNs are tailored for working with
					sequential data. For the technical explanation of RNNs,
					<a href="http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/">
						here is the compulsory reference to Andrej Karpathy’s blog
						post</a>, where he gives a detailed explanation of the various
					types of RNNs. This series of posts will be focused on actually
					implementing the RNNs and use them to model some data. <a
						href="https://github.com/sebastjancizel/ml-for-finance/tree/master/time_series">
						The Jupyter notebook with the code is available on my
						github.</a></p>
				<h3>Data preparation</h3>
				<p>For a first couple of posts we will work with generated
					data. The reason for this is that in this way we can ensure
					that there is a good amount of signal present in the data and
					it'll be easier to observe how different hyperparameters
					influence the prediction. That's why we begin by generating a
					time series with a linear trend, seasonality and mixing in some
					Gaussian noise. The code to generate the series is very simple;
					it's just adding together a linear trend, a seasonal component
					and normally distributed noise</p>

				<p>We'll be using <a href="https://plotly.com/">Plotly</a> to
					plot the time series, because it's so easy to make nice looking
					as well as interactive graphs with Plotly.</p>

							series and combined series with noise</span>
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>We have the time series we'll be forecasting and we now move
					to preprocessing the data that we can feed it into the neural
					network. We first split the data into train and test parts.
					Scikit-learn has a function for that but it's easy enough to do
					by hand in this case. We'll use 80% of the data for
					training.</p>
				<script src="https://gist.github.com/sebastjancizel/2aca15dfb635a25d9c2ef483be0a6b5a.js"></script>
				<p>The reshaping in line 5 looks innocent enough but it's
					crucial. The Keras RNN models we'll use expect the input to
					have three dimensions: number of batches, length of the
					sequence and number of features. The number of features is 1 in
					our case since the input is a univariate time series. For a
					multivariate time series the number of features would be equal
					to the number of variables in the time series. In our case, the
					length of the sequence is given by the <code>look_back</code>
					variable.</p>
				<p>Finally, we have to window the data. This means that we have
					to subdivide it into subsequences of fixed length that we will
					feed in the RNN. To each of these sequences we also have to
					associate the label, which is the prediction based on the
					feature window. For a simple sequence \(1,2,3,4,5,6, \dots\),
					this windowing process means constructing a dataset of the form
					\[\begin{aligned} 1, 2, 3, 4 &amp;\rightarrow 5\\ 2, 3, 4, 5
					&amp;\rightarrow 6\\ 3, 4, 5, 6 &amp;\rightarrow 7\\
					&amp;\vdots \end{aligned}\] The window length in this example
					is 4. To get to this form, Keras comes with a <code><a href=
	"https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/preprocessing/sequence/TimeseriesGenerator">
	TimeseriesGenerator</a></code> that takes care of this and
					produces the windowed dataset and also takes care of the
					batching. The function on line 14 above returns an instance of
					the <code>TimeseriesGenerator</code> object, that contains both
					the batches of windows and corresponding labels and which can
					be fed into the RNN directly. A curious quirk is that, while it
					has a <code>__getitem__()</code> method, it doesn't support the
					slicing operation. This is why we will split the dataset before
					applying it separately both to the train and test data.</p>
				<h3>Conclusion</h3>
				<p>This is it for this first part of the exploration of time
					series using neural networks. Next, we'll move on to modelling
					the data with RNNs and explore some systematic methods for
					tuning the hyperparameters.</p>
